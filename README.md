# 🎓 College Event Feedback Analysis – Data Science & Analytics Internship (Task 3)

This project is part of the **Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship**, aimed at transforming raw student feedback into actionable insights using real-world tools like **pandas, TextBlob, and Matplotlib** — all done in **Google Colab**.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

College events such as workshops, tech talks, and cultural fests generate valuable feedback from students. The main goal of this project is to analyze that feedback to:

* Understand student satisfaction
* Extract key sentiments from comments
* Recommend improvements for future events

This analysis helps event organizers make **data-driven decisions** to enhance student experience on campus.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Removed unwanted columns
* Checked for missing values
* Standardized text feedback

2️⃣ **Sentiment Analysis**

* Used TextBlob to classify each feedback comment into: Positive / Neutral / Negative
* Calculated sentiment polarity and subjectivity

3️⃣ **Visualization Dashboard**

* 📊 Bar Chart: Average rating per event type
* 🥧 Pie Chart: Distribution of sentiment categories
* ☁️ Word Cloud: Most common words in feedback
* 📈 Boxplots/Histograms: Spread and trends of ratings

4️⃣ **Key Insights**

* Identified events with highest and lowest satisfaction
* Found common complaints using text analysis
* Correlated sentiment with ratings
